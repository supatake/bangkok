## Data SIM Card
Arriving at BKK airport in Bangkok, you have the best choice. The 3 major players have their flagship stores in the arrivals hall almost side by side. So you can check prices and compare promotions.

Main carriers:

- [AIS](http://www.ais.co.th/en/)
- [dtac](http://dtac.co.th) (DTAC is owned by Telenor both directly and indirectly, and both companies share the same logo)
- [TrueMove H](http://truemoveh.truecorp.co.th/?ln=en)

Checkout this extensive guide for all the carriers: http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Thailand

## Power (Socket)
Type [A][type-a] / [B][type-b] / [C][type-c] / [F][type-f]

- Voltage: 220-240 V
- Frequency: 50 Hz

## Tipping
No need to tip, leave the coins if you want to get rid of them.

Most hospitality places (hotels, large restaurants etc.) include a *10% service charge* + *7% VAT*.

## Communication
The national language is Thai but you can use English to get your way around the city.

A list of common words can be found at [thai-language.com/ref/phrases](http://www.thai-language.com/ref/phrases)

## Getting Around

### Taxi
Use one of the following apps to ensure that the driver will follow the meter:
- [GrabTaxi](http://grabtaxi.com/bangkok-thailand/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/bangkok)
- [AllThaiTaxi](http://www.allthaitaxi.com/website/en/home/)

Many drivers will refuse to use the meter if during rush hour or if itâ€™s raining. Usually best to try and hail a cab off the street and avoid ones that loiter around tourist spots.
